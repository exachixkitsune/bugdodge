# bugdodge

A game made fro the desert bus game jam 2024; based on the prompt of "The journey, the aftermath, the horror of a Bug Splat".

You are a bug.

There are desert buses driving down the road at you.

Don't get hit.


Endless mode:

Buses spawn periodically, randomly at intervals. They spawn directly in front of the player so you *must* dodge.

You get one point every 10 minutes you remain alive.


Other modes maybe coming later?
